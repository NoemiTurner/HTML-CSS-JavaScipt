<!--Web Browsers
    The purpose of a web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari) is to read HTML 
    documents and display them correctly.

    A web browser does not display the HTML tags, but uses them to 
    determine how to display the document
-->

<!-- HTML History
    1989 - Tim Berners-Lee invented www
    1991 - Tim Berners-Lee invented HTML
-->

<!--lang Attribute: include the lang attribute inside the <html> tag to declare the language of the Web page.
    This is meant to assist search engines and browsers.
    Country codes can also be added to the language code in the lang attribute.
-->

<!DOCTYPE html> <!--declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document-->
<html lang="en-US"> <!--element is the root element of an HTML page-->

<head> <!--element contains meta information about the HTML page-->
<title>Page Title</title> <!--element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the brower's title bar)-->
</head>

<body> 
    <!--the body element defines the document's body, and is a container for all
    the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
    -->

    <h1 style="background-color:#E2B0CE;"> My 90's School Locker <h1>
    <h1>My First Heading</h1> <!--defines a large heading-->
    
    <br>

    <!--HTML tags are not case sensitive-->
    <Br>

    <p>My first paragraph.</p> <!--defines a paragraph-->
    <p>This is another paragraph.</p>

    <!--Headings are important:
        Search engines use the headings to index the structure and content of your web pages.
        Note: Use HTML headings for headings only. Do not use headings to make text big or bold
    -->
    <h1>This is heading 1</h1>  <!--Should be used for main headings-->
    <h2>This is heading 2</h2> <!--Should be used for headings-->
    <h3>This is heading 3</h3>
    <h4>This is heading 4</h4>
    <h5>This is heading 5</h5>
    <h6>This is heading 6</h6>

    <!--Bigger Headings:
        Each HTML heading has a default size. However, you can specify the size for any heading
        with the style attribute, using the CSS font-size property
    -->
    <h1 style="font-size:60px;">Heading 1</h1>


    <!--HTML Attributes:
        All HTML elements can have attribrutes
        Attributes provide additional information about elements
        Attributes are always specified in the start tag
        Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"
    -->

    <!--HTML links are defined with the <a> tag-->
    <!--The link's destination is specified by the href attribute.-->
    <!--Attributes are used to provide additional information about HTML elements-->
    <a href="https://www.google.com/"> This is a link</a>

    <!--HTML Images are definied with the <img> tag.
        The source file (src), alternative text (alt), width, 
        and height are provided as attributes.

        The src attibute specifies the path to the image to be displayed.
        There are two ways to specifiy the URL in the src attribute:
        1. Absolute URL - Links to an external image that is hosted on another website
        2. Relative URL - Links to an image that is hosted within the website.
            * If the URL begins without a slash, it will be relative to the current page
            * If the URL begins with a slash, it will be relative to the domain
            Note: It is usually better to use relative URLs because they will not break if you change domain.

    <img src="mcEscherQuote.jpg" alt="A photo of a quote by MC Escher that is on a wall of an art gallery exhibit" width="600" height="500">

    <!--The style attribute is used to add styles to an element such as color, font, size, and more-->
    <p style="color:green;">This is a green paragraph.</p>

    <!--The title attribute defines some extra information about an element
        The value of the title attribute will be displayed as a tooltip when you
        mouse over the element
    -->
    <p title="I'm a tooltip" style="color:pink;">This is a pink paragraph</p>

    <!--W3Schools suggestions: 
        - Always use lowercase attribute names
        - Always quote attribute values
        - Double quotes around attribute values are most common in HTML, but single quotes can also be used.
