<!--History of CSS: 
HTML was created to describte the content of a web page.
HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page!
When tags like <font>, and color attributes were added to HTML 3.4 specification,
it started a nightmare for web developers. Development of large websites, where fonts and color
information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process.

To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS.

CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page.
The style defintions are normally saved in external .css files.
With an external stylesheet file, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!-->

<!DOCTYPE html> <!--declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document-->
<html lang="en-US">  <!--element is the root element of an HTML page-->
<head>

<style>
body {
  background-color: lightpink;
}

h1 {
  color: white;
  text-align: center;
}

p {
  font-family: verdana;
  font-size: 20px;
}
</style>

</head>
